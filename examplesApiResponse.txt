YouTube is also a great resource for tutorials on how to code in Python.\n\n3. **Practice Coding**: The best way to learn programming is by doing it. Try solving problems from websites like LeetCode, HackerRank etc. \n\n4. **Work on Projects**: Start with small projects and gradually take on larger ones as you get comfortable. This will help reinforce your learning and provide practical experience.\n\n5. **Read Python Documentation**: The official Python documentation is a great resource for understanding how things work in Python.\n\n6. **Join Coding Communities**: Websites like Stack Overflow, GitHub, Reddit etc., are platforms where you can learn from others and also get help when you're stuck with your code. \n\n7. **Keep Updated**: Python is a constantly evolving language. Make sure to check its latest updates and improvements regularly.\n\n8. **Debugging**: Debugging is an important part of programming that can be learnt through practice. Understanding how to debug effectively will help you in solving any issues that may arise while writing your code. \n\n9. **Import Libraries**: Python has a vast library collection which provides support for various functionalities, from web-based applications to machine learning and scientific computing. Start exploring them.\n\n10. **Read other's Code**: Reading and understanding others' code is a great way to learn new techniques or understand different ways of solving problems. It can also help you write better code in the long run.\n\nRemember, consistent practice is key. Happy learning Python!\n"
